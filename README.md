# WebAccessibility_BA
This repository is a dedicated codebase for conducting experiments regarding my bachelor thesis, comparing the web accessibility aspects of UI components in Angular and Web Components
## build project
To test out the angular components follow these steps:
- run `cd TestingApp/`
- run `npm run build:components` or, in case you want to make changes to the components and have them rebuilt as an angular package automatically, run `npm run build:components-watch`
- run `ng serve`. Note: if you have chosen to have the components package rebuilt automatically, you'll need to run this in a separate terminal
- open 'http://localhost:4200/' in your browser
